## 📌 Program Overview  
### **Your AWS Certification Is Not Just a Badge — It’s a Professional Re‑definition**  

You might already:  
- Launch EC2 instances  
- Migrate workloads to AWS  
- Build multi-tier applications  

But without certified knowledge, your contributions remain under‑recognized.  
  
Certified architects, on the other hand:  
- Lead architecture reviews  
- Design high‑availability, disaster‑recovery, and highly scalable systems  
- Make infrastructure decisions balancing cost, performance, security, and reliability  

This training bridges the gap — from hands-on ops to strategic architecture.
